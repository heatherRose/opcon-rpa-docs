# Introduction to Robotic Process Automation (RPA)

OpCon Robotic Process Automation (RPA) continues automation through the **last mile** whether on a desktop, the web, or a hybrid of both. Where OpCon workflows, processes, or tasks pause for human intervention, OpCon RPA addresses manual gaps, enables end-to-end automation, and increases the efficiency of individual employees and the entire business. 

OpCon RPA is an OpCon extension with exponential implications. 


## Getting Started

**Robotic Process Automation** refers the ability to record a sequence of human interactions (keystrokes and mouse movements and clicks) with a program and play them back on demand.  

**OpCon RPA** is designed for banks, credit unions, and insurance companies for use in tandem with OpCon extending its functionality and usefulness.
